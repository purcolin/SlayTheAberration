# BETA
# For Developers:
### New Packs should be similar to the current packs, especially the origin three packs, COLD WORM AND DEEP. 
### All power images should be named to the same format, so are the power classes, for example, "XyzDescentXyz"
## In one pack, these classes are necessary: 
* ### Pack (extending AbstractAberrationPack), 
* ### CardModifier(Named by XyzCard extending AbstractInjectedCard), 
* ### BossPower(extending AbstractPower by basemod), 
* ### MonsterPower(Likely to the pre one)
* ### gene(Extending AbstractGene). 
* ### Resources, including a folder named "**Descent" with images named with prefix "**Descent", each language should have a localization file being Json format including all the strings.
